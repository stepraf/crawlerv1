# Vantiva Unveils Revolutionary Wi-Fi 7 Condor 5G FWA Home Gateway 
03 Mar 2025 
|
9 min
Barcelona, Spain – March 3, 2025 – **Vantiva (Euronext Paris: VANTI)** , a global technology leader in connectivity, officially launches the Condor 5G Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) home gateway at Mobile World Congress 2025—an advanced, industry-leading platform designed to deliver exceptional indoor 5G connectivity, with performance approaching that of outdoor units. Aimed at tech-forward homes and businesses, the Condor 5G builds on its predecessors, the Cobra 5G and Falcon 5G, elevating in-home wireless experiences with cutting-edge innovations and a sustainable design.
## Cutting-Edge Performance Meets Sleek Innovation
The growth of FWA deployments often saturates cellular networks, particularly on lower bands. Vantiva’s engineers introduced several key innovations to the Condor 5G to address spectrum efficiency challenges while enhancing performance:
  * Near-Window Form Factor: Optimized to boost 5G performance when placed near windows. Its sleek, unobtrusive design integrates seamlessly into any home environment while facilitating ideal placement.
  * Indoor5G™ 180° Antenna System: Features up to 8 antennas, including patented boosters for mid-band connectivity (2.5–4.2 GHz), delivering up to 11 dBi gain with high efficiency. Developed by Vantiva’s antenna team, the system enhances 5G spectrum utilization, expands base station coverage, and prevents network congestion by supporting more connected users.
  * RuralBoost™ Technology: Provides increased receive sensitivity on low bands when the network requires it, reducing the strain on this critical part of the spectrum.
  * 8Rx Capability: Equipped with 8 receive antennas, the Condor 5G ensures extended coverage and high reliability, particularly in challenging environments with physical barriers or long distances. By leveraging experience from the Cobra 5G Xtream, the world’s first 8Rx 5G indoor CPE. The Condor 5G offers full 8Rx support on n38, n41, n77, and n78 bandwidths.


> “We are excited to see our Qualcomm Dragonwing™ FWA Gen 3 platform integrated to power Vantiva’s Condor 5G offering and Indoor5G™ 180° antenna technology,” said Gautam Sheoran, Vice President and General Manager, Wireless Broadband & Communications at Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. “We look forward to seeing operators dramatically expand their FWA service coverage while connecting more homes with high-performance 5G broadband service.”
## Advanced Features for Next-Level Connectivity
The Condor 5G is built with advanced components to ensure durability and future readiness for both consumers and operators over the next five years. Key features include:
  * 3GPP Release 17 Modem Technology: Fully interoperable with Tier-1 operators’ 5G networks, including support for advanced carrier aggregation in NSA and SA (2 CC in the uplink and up to 4x nR-CC in the downlink).
  * Dual-Band Wi-Fi 7 (BE7200): A 4×4 configuration delivers seamless multi-device connectivity with powerful antennas on both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz channels, ensuring maximum Wi-Fi coverage throughout the home.
  * NaviGate Companion™ App: Offers users an intuitive smartphone application for simple self-installation, management, and control of their FWA setup


## Delivering Value to Operators
The Condor 5G integrates Vantiva’s [Homeware™, an OpenWRT middleware solution](https://www.vantiva.com/connected-home/broadband/vantiva-homeware/) utilized by Tier-1 operators globally. Its container-based architecture supports a broad range of third-party applications, enabling operators to provide FWA subscribers access to the same value-added services typically reserved for fiber, copper, or cable customers.  
Additional operator benefits include support for USP TR-369/TR-181 data models extended to cellular data, seamless remote management, and scalability via firmware-over-the-air (FOTA) updates—all pre-integrated with Vantiva’s ECO-Manage/Control platform.
## Sustainable Design
Vantiva prioritized sustainability in the Condor 5G, incorporating features like halogen-free PCBs, optional use of recycled resins, and a fanless passive cooling solution to reduce environmental impact. A data-driven power consumption optimization feature further ensures efficient energy use.  
“With the Condor 5G, Vantiva is setting a new standard for [FWA home gateways](https://www.vantiva.com/connected-home/broadband/broadening-access-to-better-5g-broadband/),” said Ashwani Saigal, SVP Global Product Management at Vantiva. “By combining cutting-edge technology with sustainable design, we enable telecom operators to deliver unparalleled connectivity experiences to their customers while promoting a greener future.”
## Availability
The Condor 5G will be available beginning March 2025 for telecom providers and enterprise partners.

## Off-the-shelf but yours, truly

Yet, extensive branding and personalization options, from the interface to the remote control, allow you to fully immerse your subscribers in your world.
## Eco-friendly by design
In addition to Vantiva’s sustainable initiatives, such as using recycled plastic and optimizing logistics, TV dongles are inherently eco-friendly. They consume significantly less power than traditional set-top boxes and their compact size reduces material waste and resources needed for manufacturing, packaging, and shipping.
TV dongles enable users to upgrade existing traditional TVs to smart TVs, extending the lifespan of devices and minimizing electronic waste. Remotely upgradable to enhance performance and add new features, Vantiva’s TV dongles are built to last.

**Software**
# Navigate IQ™
NaviGate IQ™ is the single source of knowledge for marketing, technical operations, and quality assurance teams who want to make the best of their set-top boxes’ data.
**OVERVIEW**
## From rough data  
**to actionable knowledge**
The television landscape has evolved drastically over the last few years. There are more video services that can be offered on any network and on any platform. For Pay-TV Operators, the main challenge is providing subscribers with the right content at the right price. This requires a deep understanding of subscribers — how do they consume video content? What’s attractive to them? Which parts of the service are they not interested in? Vantiva NaviGate IQ™ helps Operators understand if their services are truly relevant, competitive, and engaging.
## Turn knowledge  
**into decision making**
Vantiva’s NaviGate IQ solution consists of a lightweight monitoring agent running on the subscriber’s set-top box (STB) leveraging Android TV™ APIs. These analytics allow a deeper understanding of the subscribers’ usage of Android TV applications and services on the STB, displayed as a convenient analytics dashboard.
![](https://www.vantiva.com/app/uploads/2024/08/standard.png)
## Service usage analytics
Access a consolidated view of subscriber behavior with the TV service and the related environment through service usage analytics. This includes the number of devices, STB usage, use of features like voice control, details on the connected TV display, recording habits, and even account sharing information.
## Content usage analytics
Content usage analytics provide comprehensive information on both the video and applications preferred by subscribers. Understand the TV content and on-demand video a subscriber watches, which content providers they prefer, how much they’re watching, which applications they’re using (or removing), and what time they prefer to watch.
![](https://www.vantiva.com/app/uploads/2024/08/ordi_analytics.png)
![](https://www.vantiva.com/app/uploads/2024/08/comics.png)
## Quality of experience  
**and customer support analytics**
Today, subscribers require a consistent, reliable experience . Quality of Experience and Customer Support analytics enable operators to identify the technical performance and usage of the STB. These analytics provide information such as Wi-Fi® usage and strength, boot time, internet network loss, STB hardware and software details, security parameters, and more.
## Navigate IQ solution brief
Vantiva’s NaviGate IQ solution consists of a lightweight monitoring agent that resides on the subscriber’s set-top box and leverages Android TV APIs. Our comprehensive solution brief offers many actionable insights for operators to leverage customer data from their Android TV set-top boxes.

## Learn more  
**about Navigate IQ™**
One of Pay TV Operators’ primary challenges is delivering the right content mix at the right price — at Vantiva, we know this means deeply understanding subscribers’ context, video consumption habits, and preferences. Equally important is identifying which aspects of the service are not valued by subscribers.
Vantiva NaviGate IQ™ helps operators assess the relevance, competitiveness, and quality of their video services, ensuring subscribers’ needs are effectively met.

**Software**
# Android TV™:  
**a smart TV OS**
## Feature-rich  
**Android TV software**
Our innovative, feature-rich Vantiva Android TV software helps operators add value to the end user experience, from easy access to their favorite apps to essential features and robust security — we can help you deliver a seamless viewing experience to end users.
Designed for smart TVs and streaming devices, Android TV simplifies the way people access and interact with the content and entertainment they love on their TVs.
## Innovate with Android TV:  
**a path to better products**
Explore two key rules for developing Android TV set-top boxes, and how this compares to Linux-based products.
![](https://www.vantiva.com/app/uploads/2024/08/standard.png)
## The industry leader  
**in Android TV software**
In the 10 years that Vantiva has been a Google premium partner, we have earned a reputation as the market leader in Android TV. We help operators provide a premium entertainment experience by offering support for applications — including development, integration, and certification — and a strategy of continuous innovation. Our firmware helps operators harness existing and emerging technologies, such as Wi-Fi® repeaters, data analytics, IoT, and far field voice to ensure that they stay in the center of their customer’s world.
## Android TV **operator tier**
We offer the Android TV Operator Tier program which enables greater customization for providers who want to create a stronger branded experience for their subscribers. Vantiva’s TV stack adds new depth to Android TV set-top box devices by seamlessly integrating traditional Pay-TV features into the Android TV environment, such as front-end configurations, security solutions, or parental control. Vantiva’s software approach also minimizes dependencies between the TV stack and partner apps, ensuring seamless integration with third-party software modules.
![](https://www.vantiva.com/app/uploads/2024/08/settopbox.png)
![](https://www.vantiva.com/app/uploads/2024/08/comics.png)
## Top Android TV certification
Vantiva is the industry-leader in software integration and certification for Android TV set-top box platforms. We have implemented more than 30 Android TV letter upgrades and the most Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Disney+ certifications in the industry. As a manufacturer, we are responsible for certifying the device for Android TV and providing ongoing maintenance. Fortunately, we have the most experienced dedicated test and certification teams in the industry, significantly reducing the time to market for operators.
## Android TV security
Content providers are strengthening their content-protection requirements, making Android TV Security an essential feature in the choice of their device manufacturer. Vantiva has more than 20 years of CAS (Conditional Access Systems) and DRM (Digital Rights Management) solutions integration experience, dedicated security teams, and ISO 27001 certification. We understand the security needs of Pay-TV operators, and work to ensure solid, secure content protection solutions in a fast-evolving market.

## The open-source  
**software platform**
Reference Design Kit for Video (RDK-V) is the open-source software platform that provides a broad range of video functionality to home gateways and set-top boxes (STBs). The Vantiva RDK-V Lab Accelerator is our way of contributing directly to this open-source platform, encouraging innovation with teams across the globe.
RDK-V accelerates the deployment of next-gen video products and services and simplifies the customization of the application and user interface.
## RDK-V, defined
RDK-V is part of the Reference Design Kit (RDK) platform, a fully modular, portable, customizable open-source platform used by hundreds of companies, including Vantiva. RDK-V enables developers and operators to use a unified software stack for STBs and home gateways across a broad range of complex video and management functions — rendering, content, content security, device management, networking, and more.
![](https://www.vantiva.com/app/uploads/2024/08/rdk_image.png)
## Embedded across  
**Vantiva devices**
Vantiva offers a high level of integration of RDK-V in its different hardware platforms. Our RDK set-top boxes are deployed with Comcast and their syndication partners, which are also moving beyond the US market to reach European operators. Every RDK-V STB produced is validated with TDK and combined with our own additional end-to-end tests with operators’ infrastructures and streams.
![](https://www.vantiva.com/app/uploads/2024/08/liste_produit1.png)
![](https://www.vantiva.com/app/uploads/2024/08/world.png)
## RDK-V teams  
**across the globe**
The RDK-V Lab Accelerator is truly an international project. Our teams based in Norcross, GA, Sunnyvale, CA, and Philadelphia, PA, support our US customers. The team in our R&C center in Rennes, France supports our EMEA customers and works on the hardware and software architecture, plus product and program management. Our teams in Chennai, India and Beijing, China work on the different building blocks, such as the loader, validation, and drivers. Together, they all ensure that Vantiva is supercharging innovation across the RDK-V platform.
## A founding contributor **to RDK**
Vantiva has been a committed innovator to RDK, donating millions of lines of code to support the platform. We believe in the power of RDK. As an independent, open-source solution, RDK is accessible to any operator and is developed and maintained by an active, engaged community of developers across the world. With tens of million devices in the world, Vantiva leads the market in North America and Europe. And with the RDK-V Lab Accelerator, Vantiva is helping RDK-V reach a new level of momentum.

### **White paper**
# **The X-factors of a Successful Customer Premises Equipment Fiber Strategy**
Indeed, fiber networks bring unprecedented speed to the home via the main gateway. In fact, the ability to deliver Gigabit speeds to the home is becoming “normal”, with operators having more options in equipment selection and customers having more choices for delivery methods. The result is operators need to compete with differentiating features beyond speed.  
  
Read Vantiva's 2023 white paper that explains the most important factors - Interoperability, open software platforms, security, Wi-Fi performance, companion mobile app and sustainability - that empower the fiber gateway, making it robust, reliable, and future proof beyond speed. Vantiva thereby brings Peace of Mind to both the operator and the customer through these capabilities embedded in our Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) devices.

### **Case Study**
# **Understanding Consumers Need, Delivering a Superior Entertainment Experience**
LG U+ Soundbar Black captures attention of Korean consumers and elevates the NSP's position as a provider of premium entertainment experiences.   
  
TV manufacturers have progressed over the years to create products that deliver an impressive image quality. But the thin design of a TV screen does not allow its integrated speakers to deliver great sound. As more and more quality content is distributed through their preferred OTT platforms, users become more and more dissatisfied with the lack of audio quality.  
  
Discover how LG U+ Soundbar Black, based on Vantiva Soundscape, a single high end Android TV 12 Set-Top-Box combined with a HARMAN with Sound-by-JBL audio solution, was designed precisely to address this customer unmet need.
